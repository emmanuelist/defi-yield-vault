# sBTCYield Platform

A non-custodial yield generation protocol for Bitcoin holders on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

sBTCYield is a sovereign yield solution for Bitcoin holders, allowing users to generate optimized DeFi returns without sacrificing security or control over their assets. The platform uses sophisticated DeFi strategies with institutional-grade security, providing Bitcoin holders with a non-custodial vault system that prioritizes complete sovereignty over assets.

The vault is implemented as a decentralized finance protocol that enables holders of sBTC (wrapped Bitcoin on Stacks) to earn compound yields through automated strategies. The system is designed to be secure, transparent, and user-controlled, allowing depositors to generate returns on their Bitcoin while maintaining custody of their assets.

### State Management

The contract maintains several data structures to track user deposits, rewards, and global state:

- **User Deposits**: Maps user principals to their deposited amounts
- **Last Deposit Block**: Tracks when users last interacted with the vault
- **User Rewards**: Accumulates earned but unclaimed rewards
- **Global Accumulator**: Tracks system-wide yield calculations
- **Contract Parameters**: Yield rate, admin controls, and protocol limits

### Yield Generation Mechanism

The yield mechanism uses a time-based accrual model:

1. Yield rate is defined in basis points (e.g., 50 = 0.5%)
2. Rewards accrue based on blocks elapsed since last deposit/interaction
3. Calculation formula: `rewards = deposit_amount * yield_rate * blocks_elapsed / yield_period`

### Security Model

The contract implements several security patterns:

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: State changes before external calls
- **Fail-safe Mechanisms**: Revert state on transfer failures
- **Administrative Timelocks**: Delayed execution of parameter changes
- **Emergency Mode**: Allows users to withdraw funds in case of protocol issues
- **Deposit Limits**: Prevents excessive concentration of funds

## User Flow

1. **Secure Bitcoin Deposit**
   - Connect wallet to the platform
   - Deposit Bitcoin into the non-custodial vault system
   - Verify transaction completion

2. **Yield Strategy Allocation**
   - Bitcoin is automatically allocated across diversified DeFi strategies
   - Allocation optimizes for maximum yield while maintaining security
   - User maintains full custody throughout the process

3. **Auto-Compounding**
   - Earned yield is automatically reinvested
   - Compounding maximizes returns through exponential growth
   - User can track compounding performance through analytics dashboard

4. **Flexible Withdrawals**
   - Access Bitcoin and earned yield at any time
   - No lock periods or withdrawal restrictions
   - Withdraw directly to connected wallet with complete control

## Integration

The vault is designed to work with the official sBTC token contract on Stacks testnet:
`ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token`

Here is the deployed contract address of the yield vault: `ST2VXPMB7WBJRS0HPJENJD7FR35907JV4X1E64DGN.sbtc-yield-vault`

## Security Considerations

1. **Yield Sustainability**: Ensure the vault has sufficient funds to pay rewards
2. **Smart Contract Risk**: Review and audit the contract before significant deposits
3. **Parameter Changes**: Monitor timelock periods for administrative actions
4. **Emergency Mode**: Understand the conditions that could trigger emergency mode
